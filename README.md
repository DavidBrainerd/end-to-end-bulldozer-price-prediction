# Bulldozer-Price-Prediction
In this project, we are going to create a machine learning algorithm in order to predict the auction sale prices of bulldozers based on it's attributes and previous sale prices of similar bulldozers.
The original data came from the kaggle website, which was for a kaggle competition, titled "Blue Book for Bulldozers". This is a link to the data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

The data for this competition is split into three parts:

Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.
Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.
